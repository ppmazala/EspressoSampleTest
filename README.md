# Test assignment

We are looking for Automation Engineers that have the mindset "only the sky is the limit" and "automation doesn't stop at testing, it's just a beginning!" ;)

The purpose of this test assignment is to assess the applicant's automation skills, allowing him/her to show the best they can do and how fast they can learn.
It is an open assignment. There is no the right answer and there is no end goal other than proving yourself. Surprise us!

Make sure that you give detailed comments or descriptions of your tests.
When the assignment is complete, please push your solution to Github(Gitlab) and send us the link to hr.grid.adi@nl.abnamro.com.
If you have any questions, please contact us at hr.grid.adi@nl.abnamro.com.

Good luck.

PS. We don't expect you to spend weeks (and sleepless nights) on doing it. Lets see how far you can get in 6-10 hours. We want to see how you approach and solve problems.

PSPS. Please use mobile native tools. (Tests written on Java are accepted too)
